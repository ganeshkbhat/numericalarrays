# numericalarrays

`ndarrays` offers `numerical arrays` which is a comprehensive mathematical functions, `random number generators`, `linear algebra routines`, `Fourier transforms`, and more like `NumPy`, `Scipy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Statistics`, `Six Sigma` Functions, `D3` Graphs for scientific graphs. The goal was to be as near as NumPy as possible, however, a combination of a few packages were being done to make this a comprehensive port for major Python Scientific packages.

The version 0.0.2 will start having the actual usable ndarrays which is a python numpy like module.

- rlib:
- regression:
- pickle:
- extenders:
- stats:
- streamStats:
- pyc:

Usage:

```
async function main() {
  let pyodide = await loadPyodide();
  // Pyodide is now ready to use...
  console.log(pyodide.runPython(`
    import sys
    sys.version
  `));
};
main();
```
